Do admins checkout tools/use machines? (Do admins have the same functionality as regular users)
Are admins automatically certified on all machines?

Security issues
  -- Should really have a student employee there (our recommendation)
What are the rules for tool checkout?
  -- Can users have multiple tools out at one time?
  -- Do they need to return current checked out tools before checking out new ones/same ones?
  -- Is there a time limit on how long a user can have a tool?
  -- Should we implement a waiting list for users/tools (time allowing)?
