Version: 1.0
Release Date: June 21, 2013

Description:

ShopTracker is a shop inventory system and access tracker. The program keeps track
or who comes and goes from the machine shop, logging their time in, time out, machines used,
and tools checked out/returned. System Administrators can edit information in the database,
such as each user's machine certifications.

ShopTracker was developed by CSM's Summer 2013 Advanced Software Enginnering Team, CSM #2.
    Development Team:
    - Nicola Hetrick
    - Taylor Sallee
    - Shawn Toffel
    - Chaeha Park

Recommended Operating System:

The application was developed in Java, so it is fairly flexible and should be able to run on
almost any machine, as long as it has a Java Runtime Environment installed. This version of
the product was tested on Windows 7, Windows XP, and Linux. All three operating systems
worked fine, using JRE 6 and JRE 7, but it should be fine on just about any system with Java.

Installation Instructions:

1. Make sure you have a Java Runtime Environment (JRE) installed on the target computer.
   Doing this is as simple as downloading Java and following the installation instructions.

Background:

The College of Engineering and Computational Sciences at The Colorado School of Mines (CSM) 
maintains a machine shop in the basement of Brown building. The machine shop
is home to many machines which require specific training to ensure safe operation.
Our software helps create a safer and more organized environment in the machine
shop by keeping track of machine safety certifications and allowing shop staff
to have fast and accurate access to certification information and the inventory database.

About the class:

Advanced Software Engineering is a required capstone course for all Computer Science
undergraduates at CSM. Students break up into small teams of two-six and complete
a project within the first six weeks of summer, usually after completing their third
academic year. Denver-area businesses and organizations often submit projects for
field session groups to complete, and each year Mines departments/faculty members
submit projects as well. This project was completed for Dr. Kevin Moore, dean of the
The College of Engineering and Computational Sciences.
